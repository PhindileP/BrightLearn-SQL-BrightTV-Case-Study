BrightTV Analysis- uncovering insights with SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Snowflake.
BrightTV Case Study

This repository contains the BrightTV Viewership Analysis Case Study, where I looked at how users watch BrightTV to find insights that can help improve content strategy and engagement.

Project Overview

The main goal was to understand BrightTV users’ viewing habits across channels, content types, and time periods. The insights can help guide programming decisions, marketing, and ways to keep viewers engaged.

1. Key things I focused on:

- Finding which content and channels are most popular.
- Grouping users based on how they watch TV.
- Spotting opportunities to increase engagement in specific regions or demographics.

2. Tools & Technologies

- Miro – Planning the project, mapping data flow, and creating visual frameworks.
- Excel – Cleaning, organizing, and analyzing the data.
- Snowflake – Querying and extracting the BrightTV dataset.
- Power BI – Creating interactive dashboards and visualizations for deeper insights.
- PowerPoint – Presenting findings and creating visual summaries.

3. Data

- The analysis used BrightTV data, including:
- User info (age, gender, province)
- Viewing activity (duration, content type, channel)
- Dates and times of viewing
- The data was cleaned, duplicates removed, and viewing durations categorized to make the analysis easier to understand.

4. Key Deliverables

- Excel workbook with cleaned and analyzed data.
- Visual dashboards and charts (Power BI) showing user behavior.
- PowerPoint slides summarizing findings and recommendations.
- Miro boards showing the analysis workflow and data mapping.

5. How to Use This Repository

- Open the Excel workbook to see the cleaned data and metrics.
- Explore the Power BI dashboards for interactive insights.
- Check the PowerPoint slides for a high-level summary of findings.
- Look at the Miro boards to understand the analysis process visually.

6. Insights & Recommendations

- Most viewing happens on weekdays, especially in the evenings.
- Certain channels and content types are more popular with specific age groups and racial groups.
- Regions have lower engagement, showing opportunities for targeted content.
- Recommendations include creating content for these gaps, adjusting schedules, and adding interactive programming to increase engagement.
